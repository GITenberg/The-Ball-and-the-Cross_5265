description: "The Ball and the Cross is a novel by G. K. Chesterton. The title refers\
  \ to a more worldly and rationalist worldview, represented by a ball or sphere,\
  \ and the cross representing Christianity. The first chapters of the book were serialized\
  \ from 1905 to 1906 with the completed work published in 1909. The novel's beginning\
  \ involves debates about rationalism and religion between a Professor Lucifer and\
  \ a monk named Michael. A part of this section was quoted in Pope John Paul I's\
  \ Illustrissimi letter to G. K. Chesterton. Much of the rest of the book concerns\
  \ the dueling, figurative and somewhat more literal, of a Jacobite Catholic named\
  \ Maclan and an atheist Socialist named Turnbull. Lynette Hunter has argued that\
  \ the novel is more sympathetic to Maclan, but does indicate Maclan is also presented\
  \ as in some ways too extreme. Turnbull, as well, is presented in a sympathetic\
  \ light: both duelists are ready to fight for and die for their antagonistic opinions\
  \ and, in doing so, develop a certain partnership that evolves into a friendship.\
  \ The real antagonist is the world outside, which desperately tries to prevent from\
  \ happening a duel over \"mere religion\" (a subject both duelists judge of utmost\
  \ importance).\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
